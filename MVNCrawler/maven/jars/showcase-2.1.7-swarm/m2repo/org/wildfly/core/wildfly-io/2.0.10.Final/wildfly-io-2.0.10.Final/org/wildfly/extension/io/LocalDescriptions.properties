io.worker=Defines workers
io.worker.add=Adds new worker
io.worker.remove=Removes worker
io.worker.task-max-threads=Specify the maximum number of threads for the worker task thread pool.\
  If not set, default value used which is calculated by formula cpuCount * 16
io.worker.stack-size=The stack size (in bytes) to attempt to use for worker threads.
io.worker.io-threads=Specify the number of I/O threads to create for the worker.  \
  If not specified, a default will be chosen, which is calculated by cpuCount * 2

io.buffer-pool=Defines buffer pool
io.buffer-pool.add=Adds new buffer pool
io.buffer-pool.remove=Removes buffer pool
io.buffer-pool.buffers-per-slice=How many buffers per slice, if not set optimal value is calculated based on available RAM resources in your system.
io.buffer-pool.buffer-size=The size of each buffer slice in bytes, if not set optimal value is calculated based on available RAM resources in your system.
io.buffer-pool.direct-buffers=Does the buffer pool use direct buffers, some platforms don't support direct buffers
