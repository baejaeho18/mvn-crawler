SYNOPSIS

   cn [node_path [--no-validation]]
   cd [node_path [--no-validation]]

DESCRIPTION

    Changes the current node path to the argument.
    The current node path is used as the address for operation requests that
    don't contain the address part. If an operation request does include the
    address, the included address is considered relative to the current node
    path. The current node path may end on a node-type. In that case,
    to execute an operation specifying a node-name would be sufficient
    (e.g. logging:read-resource).

ARGUMENTS

 node_path       - the new value for the current node path following the format
                   [node-type [=node-name (,node-type[=node-name])*]].

 --no-validation - normally (when --no-validation is not present on the line),
                   before switching to the node_path, the node_path is
                   validated to make sure that it actually exists.
                   In some cases, like batches, the validation may get
                   in the way because the target address might not yet exist.
                   If --no-validation is present the current context address
                   will be set to the node_path without validating it. 


The following navigation signs are supported in the node-path:
 /      - the root node (e.g. 'cd /' or 'cd /some=thing');
 ..     - parent node (e.g. 'cd ..');
 .type  - node type of the current node (e.g. 'cd .type').
