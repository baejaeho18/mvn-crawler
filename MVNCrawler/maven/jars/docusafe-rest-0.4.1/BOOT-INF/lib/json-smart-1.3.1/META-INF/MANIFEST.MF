Bundle-Description: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight d
 ata-interchange format.    It is easy for humans to read and write. It 
 is easy for machines to parse and generate.    It is based on a subset 
 of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition  
   - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language in
 dependent but uses    conventions that are familiar to programmers of t
 he C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#,    Java, JavaScript, Pe
 rl, Python, and many others.    These properties make JSON an ideal dat
 a-interchange language.
