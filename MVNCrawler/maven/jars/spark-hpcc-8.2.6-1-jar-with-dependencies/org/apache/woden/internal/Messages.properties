# Filename: Messages.properties
#
# This file contains the text for all messages produced by Woden.
# Each message is keyed by a message number. The file is used as
# a ResourceBundle by Woden.
#
# The messages are separated into two groups - those that relate
# to System type problems (e.g. Woden or parser configuration)
# and those that relate specifically to processing WSDL documents
# (i.e. related to the rules defined in the WSDL spec).  The
# latter group of messages will eventually correspond to asserts
# being added to the W3C WSDL spec and the message numbers will 
# be replaced with corresponding assert references.

# ------------ TODO determine if these errors are needed -------------------

# TODO - replace WSDL5xx error codes with reference numbers from the asserts
#        to be defined in the WSDL spec (i.e. err msg nos. that point to the
#        specific part of the WSDL spec that the error relates to).
# The error codes listed below match the assertion ids in the WSDL 2.0 specification.
# The error code itself is a key for the error message.
# The error code ref is a reference to the location in the specification that
# describes the assertion.
# The error code assertion is the text of the assertion from the specification.
