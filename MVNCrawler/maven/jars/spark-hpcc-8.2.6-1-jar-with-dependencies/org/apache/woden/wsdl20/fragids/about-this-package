This package implements the Fragment Identifiers for WSDL 2.0 components as defined
by Appendix A.2 of the W3C WSDL 2.0 Part 1: Core Language specification. See:

	http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl20/#frag-ids
	
The package contains classes that:

	- model the fragment identifiers for each WSDL 2.0 component
	- generate fragment identifiers from abstract components
	- find abstract components in a component model instance given their fragment identifiers
	- parse URLs into fragment identifiers
	- serialize fragment identifiers as URLs
