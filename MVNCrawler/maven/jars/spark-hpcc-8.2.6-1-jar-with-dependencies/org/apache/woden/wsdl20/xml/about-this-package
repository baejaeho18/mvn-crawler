XML-related API to support the WSDL 2.0 component model.
i.e. the WSDL 2.0 API needed by tooling and editors that
must manipulate the WSDL XML (where the abstract component
model is not sufficient). 

This package is used only for those XML elements that are 
in the WSDL 2.0 namespace. It includes the WSDL20Element
interface which all other interfaces in this package must
extend (i.e. so they share a common type).
