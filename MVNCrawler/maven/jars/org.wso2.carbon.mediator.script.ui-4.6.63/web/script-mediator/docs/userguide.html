<h1>Script Mediator</h1>
<p>
Synapse supports Mediators implemented in a variety of scripting languages such as JavaScript, 
Python or Ruby. There are two ways of defining script mediators, either with the script program 
statements stored in a separate file which is referenced via the local or remote registry entry, 
or with the script program statements embedded in-line within the Synapse configuration.
