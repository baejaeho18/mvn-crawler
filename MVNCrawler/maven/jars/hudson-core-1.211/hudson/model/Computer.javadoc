isJnlpAgent()=\ Returns true if this computer is supposed to be launched via JNLP.\n
getMonitorData()=\ Expose monitoring data for the remote API.\n
isTemporarilyOffline()=\ Returns true if this node is marked temporarily offline by the user.\n\n <p>\n In contrast, {@link \#isOffline()} represents the actual online/offline\n state. For example, this method may return false while {@link \#isOffline()}\n returns true if the slave agent failed to launch.\n\n @deprecated\n      You should almost always want {@link \#isOffline()}.\n      This method is marked as deprecated to warn people when they\n      accidentally call this method.\n
