A <<model,build>> can be linked to other builds.

To create links:

[source,groovy]
----
def build = ...
build.buildLink 'project1', '11.0'
build.buildLink 'project2', '2.3.1'
----

TIP: Several links can be attached to a build, by calling the `buildLink` method several times.

IMPORTANT: The target project and build _must_ exist.

To get the list of linked builds:

[source,groovy]
----
def links = build.buildLinks
assert links.size == 2
def link = links[0]
assert link.project = 'project1'
assert link.branch = '...'
assert link.name = '11.0'
assert link.page = '...' // URL to the build page
----

The `page` property of the link is a URL to the page of the link.
