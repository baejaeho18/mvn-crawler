Download a file from the branch SCM.

The branch _must_ be associated with a SCM branch, for <<usage-git,Git>> or <<usage-subversion,Subversion>>. If not,
the call will fail.

The `path` is relative to the root of the branch in the SCM and is always returned as text.

IMPORTANT: For security, only users allowed to configure the project will be able to download a file from the branch.
           See <<security>> for the list of roles.

See also <<dsl-scm>>.
