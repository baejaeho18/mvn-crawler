Returns an object describing the associated Jenkins build or `null` if none.

The returned object contains the following attributes:

* a `configuration` object, having itself a `name` and a `url` attribute
* a `name` - path to the job in Jenkins
* a `url` - absolute URL to the build page
* a `pathComponents` list of string - same than `path` but as list of separate components
* a `build` number

IMPORTANT: Even if a link to a Jenkins build is registered, this does not mean that the actual Jenkins build
           still actually exists.
