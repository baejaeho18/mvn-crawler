The `configuration` parameter is the name of an existing Jenkins configuration.

The `job` parameter is the path to the Jenkins job. For a job `test` as the Jenkins root, it would be only `test`
but for a job `test2` in a folder `parent2` which is itself in a folder `parent1` at the root, this would
be `parent1/parent2/test2`.

The `buildNumber` is the number of the Jenkins build.
