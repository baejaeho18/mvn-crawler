<<branches-stale,Stale branches>> can be automatically disabled or even deleted.

To enable this property on a project:

[source,groovy]
----
ontrack.project('project').config {
   stale 15, 30
}

def property = ontrack.project('project').config.stale
assert property.disablingDuration == 15
assert property.deletingDuration == 30
assert property.promotionsToKeep == []
----

It is possible to make sure to keep branches which have been promoted to some levels. For example, if you want
to keep branches which have been promoted to `PRODUCTION`:

[source,groovy]
----
ontrack.project('project').config {
   stale 15, 30, ['PRODUCTION']
}

def property = ontrack.project('project').config.stale
assert property.disablingDuration == 15
assert property.deletingDuration == 30
assert property.promotionsToKeep == ['PRODUCTION']
----
