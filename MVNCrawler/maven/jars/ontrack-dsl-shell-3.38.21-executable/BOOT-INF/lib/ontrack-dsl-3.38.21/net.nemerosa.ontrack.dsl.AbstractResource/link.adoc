The `name` of the link refers to a link which is embedded in the JSON representation of the resource. In the JSON,
the link name is prefixed by `_` but the `name` does not have too.

For example, `link('create')` and `link('_create')` are equivalent.

If the link does not exist, an `ResourceMissingLinkException` error is thrown.

The value of the link can be called using the <<dsl-ontrack>> methods:

[source,groovy]
----
def project = ontrack.projects[0]
def projectJson = ontrack.get(project.link('self'))
----
