Example of build searches:

[source,groovy]
----
def project = ontrack.project('project')
// List of last builds
def builds = project.search()
// Last build only
def build = project.search(maximumCount: 1)[0]
// Last build promoted to BRONZE
def build = project.search(promotionName: 'BRONZE', maximumCount: 1)[0]
// Creating a branch
ontrack.project('project') {
   branch 'MyBranch'
}
// Getting the list of branches
assert ontrack.project('project').branches.find { it.name == 'MyBranch' }
