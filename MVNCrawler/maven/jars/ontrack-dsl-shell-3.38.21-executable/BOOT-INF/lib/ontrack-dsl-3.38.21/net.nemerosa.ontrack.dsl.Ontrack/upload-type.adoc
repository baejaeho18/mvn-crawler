Creates a multi-part upload request where the `name` part contains the content of the given input `o` object. The
content depends on the type of object:

* for a `net.nemerosa.ontrack.dsl.Document`, uploads this document - the `contentType` parameter is then ignored
* for a `File` or `URL`, the content of the file is uploaded, using the provided `contentType`
* for a `byte` array, the content of the array is uploaded, using the provided `contentType`
* for a `String`:
** if starting with `classpath:`, the remainder of the string is used as a resource path (see `URL` above)
** if a valid `URL`, we use the string as a URL - see above
** if any other case, we consider the string to be the path to a file - see `File` above
