Builds can be <<promotion-levels-auto-promotion,auto promoted>> to a <<model,promotion level>> when this latter is
configured to do so.

A promotion level is configured for auto promotion using:

[source,groovy]
----
ontrack.promotionLevel('project', 'branch', 'promotionLevel').config {
   autoPromotion 'VS1', 'VS2'
}
----

where `VS1`, `VS2` are the <<model,validation stamps>> which must be `PASSED` in order to promote a build automatically.

To get the list of validation stamps for the auto promotion of a promotion level:

[source,groovy]
----
def validationStamps = ontrack.promotionLevel('project', 'branch', 'promotionLevel')
   .config
   .autoPromotion
   .validationStamps
----

The validation stamps used to define an auto promotion can also be defined using regular expressions:

[source,groovy]
----
ontrack.promotionLevel('project', 'branch', 'promotionLevel').config {
   autoPromotion [], 'VS.*'
}
----

In this sample, all validation stamps whose name starts with `VS` will participate in the promotion.

You can also exclude validation stamps using their name:

[source,groovy]
----
ontrack.promotionLevel('project', 'branch', 'promotionLevel').config {
   autoPromotion [], 'VS.*', 'VS/.1'
}
----

In this sample, all validation stamps whose name starts with `VS` will participate in the promotion, but for the
`VS.1` one.
