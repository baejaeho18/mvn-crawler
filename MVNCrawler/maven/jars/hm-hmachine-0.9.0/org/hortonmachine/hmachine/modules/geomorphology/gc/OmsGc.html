Subdivides the sites of a basin in 11 topographic classes, nine of which are deﬁned according to the program TC.
<p> 
Such classes are the nine classes based  obtained with
[Tc] ; the points belonging to the channel networks constitute a tenth class (derived from the use of
ExtractNetwork), the points with high slope (higher than a critical angle) the eleventh class.

<h3>Inputs</h3>
<ol>
<li>The !GridCoverage containing the slopes, obtained with [Slope] or [Gradient];</li>
<li>The !GridCoverage containing the channel network, obtained with [ExtractNetwork];</li>
<li>The !GridCoverage containing the subdivisions in curvature classes, obtained with [Tc];</li>
</ol>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Outputs</h3>
<ol>
<li>The !GridCoverage containing the subdivision in the 11 predeﬁned classes;</li>
<li>The !GridCoverage  of the aggregated classes (hillslope, valleys and net);</li>
</ol>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Differently from the program TC, the program GC considers also the existence of the channel net,
which is extracted from the DEM. The channel net is thought as a topologically connected network,
even though it is known that this cannot be the real case.
</p>
<p> The cases are identiﬁed as in TC plus:
<ul>
<li> 100 → channel sites (individuated by extract network)</li>
<li> 110 → unconditionally unstable sites (slope > critic value)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The second output ﬁle contains an aggregation of these classes in the four fundamentals, indexed as
follows:
<ol>
<li> 15 → non-channeled valley sites (classi 70, 90, 30 )</li>
<li> 25 → planar sites (classi 10)</li>
<li> 35 → channel sites (classe 100)</li>
<li> 45 → hillslope sites (classi 20, 40, 50, 60, 80)</li>
</ol>
