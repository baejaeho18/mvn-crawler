<p>Select a <i>hillslope</i> or some of its property from the <b>DEM</b>. Since hillslope
are identiﬁed by channel links, if a numbering of links is available, it gives to any pixel
draining into a given link the link number.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Inputs</h3>
<ol>
<li>The !GridCoverage containing the matrix of the drainage directions, obtained with [Markoutlets];</li>
<li>The !GridCoverage containing the network, obtained with [ExtractNetwork];</li>
<li>The !GridCoverage containing the attribute to estimate;</li>
</ol>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Output</h3>
<ol>
<li>The !GridCoverage for each hillslope pixel the attribute of the network pixel in which it drains;</li>
</ol>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p> Eventually, one can select all the hillslope points which
share the same link number, i.e. the points which belongs to the same hillslope. Another use of this
application is to associate to any hillslope point its channel path length. In general, it labels
any hillslope pixel with the channel quantity found in the position where the hillslope pixel drains.
