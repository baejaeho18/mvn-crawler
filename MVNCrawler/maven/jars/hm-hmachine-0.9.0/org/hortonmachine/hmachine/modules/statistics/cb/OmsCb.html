Calculates the histogram of a set of data contained in a matrix with respect to the set of data contained in another matrix. In substance, a map of R<sup>2</sup> to R<sup>2</sup>, in which each point of a bidimensional system (identified by the values contained in a matrix) is mapped in a second bidimensional system, is produced. The data of the first set are then grouped in a prefixed number of intervals and the mean value of the independent variable for each interval is calculated.
<br>
To every interval corresponds a certain set of values of the second set, of which the mean value is calculated, and a designate number of moments which can be either centred, if the functioning mode is <i>histogram</i>, or non-centred, if the mode is 'moments'. 
<br>
If the number of intervals assigned is lesser than one, the data are subdivided in classes of data having the same abscissa.

<h3>Inputs</h3>
<ul>      
<li>file containing the data of the independent variable (map1)</li>
<li>file containing the data which will be used as dependent variable (map2)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Output</h3>
<ul>      
<li>the name of the output file with the elaborations</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Notes</h3>
The output file is not a map and contains:
<ul> 
<li>the number of elements in each interval</li>
<li>the mean value of the data in abscissa</li>
<li>the mean value of the data in ordinate</li>
<li>the n-esimal moment of the data in ordinate</li>
</ul>
The program uses the memory intensely. Therefore if we decide to have so many intervals as the data in abscissa, the program could not function correctly.
