It extracts the channel network from the drainage directions in five possible ways:
<ol>
<li>by using a threshold value on the contributing areas, then only
the pixels with contributing area greater than the threshold are the
channel heads (mode 0)</li>
<li>by using a threshold value of the estimated stress tangential to the bottom (mode 1)</li>
<li>by using a threshold value on the estimated stress tangential to the bottom only in convergent sites (mode 2)</li>
</ol>
Individuated the beginning of the channel incision, the points upriver
are considered as canalized.

<h3>Inputs</h3>
<ul>      
<li>the file containing the matrix of the drainage directions (obtained with DrainDir or Markoutlets)</li>
<li>the file containing the matrix of contributing areas (calculated
with DrainDir, Tca or Multitca)</li>
<li>if we choose mode 1, the file containing the matrix of the slopes (calculated with Gradient or Slope)</li>
<li>if we choose mode 2, the file containing the matrix with the classes aggregated by GC</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Output</h3>
<ul>      
<li>the file containing the matrix which individuates the channel
network</li>
<li>the file containing the total contributing areas calculated with the new drainage directions</li>
<li>if we choose to create the vector layer of the extracted network, the vector map with the channel network ("filePath" is the path
plus the file name of the vector layer)</li>
</ul>
