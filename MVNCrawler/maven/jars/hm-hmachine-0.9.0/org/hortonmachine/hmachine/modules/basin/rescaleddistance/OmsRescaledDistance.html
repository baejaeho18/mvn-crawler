Calculates the rescaled distance of each pixel from the outlet. Such distance is so defined:
<table>
<tr>
<td>
   x' = x<sub>c</sub> + rx<sub>h</sub>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
where: 
<ul>
<li>x<sub>c</sub> is the distance along the channels</li>
<li>r=c/c<sub>h</sub> the ratio between the speed in the channel state
<i>c</i> and the speed in the hillslopes <i>c<sub>h</sub></i> </li>
<li><i>x<sub>h</sub></i> the distance along the hillslopes</li>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Inputs</h3>
<ul>      
<li>the file containing the matrix of the drainage directions (obtained with DrainDir)</li>
<li>the file containing the net (obtained with ExtractNetwork)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Output</h3>
<ul>      
<li>the file containing the matrix of the rescaled distances</li> 
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Notes</h3>
The program requests also the ratio <i>r</i> between speed in the channel and speed in hillslopes. The speed in channels is always greater than that in hillslopes.
