An implementation of the ordinary kriging algorithm. This is a time dependent model, it runs over all the timesteps in the input data file.
<br>
The <i>Kriging</i> is a group of <b>geostatistical</b> techniques to interpolate the value of a random field (e.g., the elevation, z, of the landscape as a function of the geographic location) at an unobserved location from observations of its value at nearby locations. (for more details see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriging">kriging</a>.
<br>
<br>
The interpolation algorithm used for Kriging can be one of the following two:
<ul>
<li>integral scale</li>
<li>gaussian variogram model</li>
</ul>
When selecting the interpolation function the user should provide the specific requested data.
<br>
<br>
It is possible run the model in 4 modes: 
<ul>
<li>mode = 0: output values on a non-regular grid, it should be provided the vector of points where to interpolate <i>pointsToInterpolate</i>. This is a 2-D interpolation, so the z coordinates are not considered.</li>
<li>mode = 1: output values on a non-regular grid, it should be provided the vector of points where to interpolate <i>pointsToInterpolate</i>. This is a 3-D interpolation.</li>
<li>mode = 2: output values on a regular grid, it should be provided the raster <i>gridToInterpolate</i> where to interpolate. This is a 2-D interpolation so the z coordinates are not considered. <b>NOT YET IMPLEMENTED</b></li> 
<li>mode = 3: output values on a regular grid, it should be provided the raster <i>gridToInterpolate</i> where to interpolate. This is a 3-D interpolation, so the provided raster data have to contain a elevations.<b>NOT YET IMPLEMENTED</b></li>
</ul>
