<p>Calculates for each hillslope pixel its distance from the river networks, following the steepest
descent (i.e. the drainage directions). It can evaluate the distance a projection of the plan or the real distance (3d mode).
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Inputs</h3>
<ol>
<li>The !GridCoverage containing the drainage directions, obtained with [Markoutlets];</li>
<li>The !GridCoverage containing the network, obtained with [ExtractNetwork];</li>
<li>The !GridCoverage containing the elevation, obteined with [Pitﬁller];</li>
</ol>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Output</h3>
<ol>
<li>The !GridCoverage containing the distance of every point from the river network;</li>
</ol>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Notes</h3>
The program can work in three different ways: 
<ol>
<li> calculate the distance (projected on the plane)  from the outlet in pixel number (pMode = 0)</li>
<li> calculate the distance (projected on the plane)  from the outlet in meters on the plane (pMode = 1 and inPit null)</li>
<li> calculate the distance (in 3d) from the outlet in meters in 3d (pMode = 1 and the inPit map not null)</li>
</ol>
