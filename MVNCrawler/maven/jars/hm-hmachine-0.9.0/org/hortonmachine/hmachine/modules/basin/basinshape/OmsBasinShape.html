Creates a vector map of the subbasins created with the Netnumbering module.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Inputs</h3>
<ul>      
<li>the file containing the elevations (obtained with Pitfiller)</li>
<li>the file containing the extracted numbered subbasins for an area (obtained with Netnumbering)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Output</h3>
<ul>      
<li>the file containing the extracted basins vector map</li> 
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Notes</h3>
The program will add the number ID of each basin obtained in Netnumbering as an attribute in the vector map. Other calculated attributes are:
<ul>      
<li>area in m<sup>2</sup></li>
<li>perimeter in m</li>
<li>max elevation in m over the sea level</li>
<li>min elevation in m over the sea level</li>
<li>average elevation in m over the sea level</li>
<li>elevation of the centroid of the basin in m over the sea level</li>
</ul>
