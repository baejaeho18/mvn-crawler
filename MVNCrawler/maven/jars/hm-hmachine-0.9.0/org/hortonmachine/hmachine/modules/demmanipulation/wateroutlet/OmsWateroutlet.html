Generates a watershed basin from a drainage direction map and a set of coordinates representing the outlet point of watershed.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Inputs</h3>
<ul>      
<li>the map containing the drainage directions (obtained with Markoutlets, DrainDir, FlowDirections)</li>
<li>the coordinates of the water outlet (east and north)</li>
<li>the map containing the channel network (obtained with ExtractNetwork)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Output</h3>
<ul>      
<li>the basin extracted mask (basin)</li> 
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Notes</h3>
The most important thing in this module is to choose a good water outlet. If the coordinates are unknown click with the mouse on the network map ensuring to select a pixel on the extracted network (value 2 in the network map).
