A java implementation of the <b>trento_p</b> program (written by <i>Riccardo
Rigon and David Tamanini</i> in c).

<p>
The aim of this class is to project and verify sewer pipes (not under
pressure). This class is designed to work in two modality:
<ol>
<li><b>Project</b>, which calculate the pipes diameter, and depth, of a point
network.
<li><b>Verify</b>, which calculate the discharge of a pipes network.
</ol>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
For more details about the computational method see <a href="http
://www.ing.unitn.it/dica/hp/?user=rigon/"> trento_p manual</a>
</p>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p>
The model needs several parameter, the <b>necessary</b> parameters are:
<ol>
<li> pAccuracy,
<li> pTest, which indicate if the program runs in verify or project mode.
</ol>
And also, only for the project mode:
<ol>
<li>pA
<li>pN
<li>pTau
<li>pAlign
</ol>

The other parameters can be not set because they have a default value.
</p>


<h3>Inputs</h3>
<p>
As input the module needs a <b><i>FeatureCollection</i></b>,inPipesFC, with
<i>LineString</i> as geometry, and with several fields that characterize the
pipe.
<p>
Usually The input network is obtained from a <i>shp file</i>. It's necessary that the
geometries of the shape are LineString and each line (which is a
pipe) must have the following fields:
<ol>
<li>ID, is the identifier name of the pipe .
<li>Drain Area, which is the amount of area which drain in this pipe and
is in ha = 10^{-2} km^2 .
<li>initial Elevation of the terrain (at the first extreme), is in meter
over the see level.
<li>Final Elevation of the terrain(at the second extreme), is in meter
over the see level.
<li>The Runoff coefficient.
<li>The average residence time,per unit area.
<li>Ks, Gauckler-Strickler coefficient.
<li>Minimum pipe slope (%).
<li>Pipe section type: 1=circular, 2=rectangular, 3=trapezoidal.
<li>Average state slope computed as the weighted mean of the state
elevation; the weights are the areas at the same height within the state.
<li>Diameter to verify (in verify mode).
<li>Slope to verify (in verify mode).
</ol>
</p>
<p>
All of this value are caractherized a pipe so are stored in a
Pipe object.
</p>
<p>
If the mode is project there is also the <b>inDiameters</b> array, which contains a set of commercial pipes diameter.
If the mode is verify there is another input fields: <b>inRain</b>, which contains the rain data.
</p>
<h3>Outputs</h3>
If the mode is project the output is a network stored in a FeatureCollection. 
<p>
The geometries are LineString and are obtained from
<b>inPipesFC<b>. In each feature are stored from a Pipe :
<ol>
<li>ID, is the identifier name of the pipe.
<li>ID pipe where drain, which is the ID of the pipe where the current
pipe drains.
<li>Drain Area, which is the amount of area which drain in this pipe and
is in ha = 10^{-2} km^2.
<li>initial Elevation of the terrain (at the first extreme), is in meter
over the see level.
<li>Final Elevation of the terrain(at the second extreme), is in meter
over the see level.
<li>The Runoff coefficient.
<li>The average residence time,per unit area.
<li>Ks, Gauckler-Strickler coefficient.
<li>Minimum pipe slope (%).
<li>Pipe section type: 1=circular, 2=rectangular, 3=trapezoidal.
<li>Average state slope computed as the weighted mean of the state
elevation; the weights are the areas at the same height within the state.
<li>Diameter to verify (in verify mode).
<li>Slope to verify (in verify mode),.
<li>Discharge in Q[l/s].
<li>Udometric coefficient [l/s ha].
<li>Residence time [min].
<li>tP[min].
<li>Time at the maximum discharge [min].
<li>Mean of the speed in the pipe,[m/s] .
<li>Pipe slope,{field of the property.
<li>Diameter in cm,{field of the property.
<li>Empthy degree,{field of the property.
<li>Initial pipe depth, is the depth of the dig.
<li>Final pipe depth, is the depth of the dig.
<li>Initial free surface depth.
<li>Final free surface depth.
<li> The area of the sub basin with the current pipe as outlet.
<li> The tiotal length of thr subnetwork.
<li> The mean length of the sub network pipes.
<li> The variance of the subnetwork pipes.
</ol>

<ol>
<li><b>Project</b>: A fetureCollection ({@link #outPipesFC}) with the net (as
in the {@link #inPipesFC}) and with the result as a field of features.
<li><b>Verify</b>: A matrix which contains the discharg at each time for each
pipe.
