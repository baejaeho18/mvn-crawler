org.optaplanner.quarkus.deployment.TerminationBuildTimeConfig.spentLimit=How long the solver can run.\nFor example\: "30s" is 30 seconds. "5m" is 5 minutes. "2h" is 2 hours. "1d" is 1 day.\nAlso supports ISO-8601 format, see {@link Duration}.
org.optaplanner.quarkus.deployment.SolverBuildTimeConfig.environmentMode=Enable runtime assertions to detect common bugs in your implementation during development.\nDefaults to {@link EnvironmentMode\#REPRODUCIBLE}.
org.optaplanner.quarkus.deployment.OptaPlannerBuildTimeConfig.solverConfigXml=A classpath resource to read the solver configuration XML.\nDefaults to {@value DEFAULT_SOLVER_CONFIG_URL}.\nIf this property isn't specified, that solverConfig.xml is optional.
org.optaplanner.quarkus.deployment.OptaPlannerBuildTimeConfig.solver=Configuration properties that overwrite OptaPlanner's {@link SolverConfig}.
org.optaplanner.quarkus.deployment.TerminationBuildTimeConfig.unimprovedSpentLimit=How long the solver can run without finding a new best solution after finding a new best solution.\nFor example\: "30s" is 30 seconds. "5m" is 5 minutes. "2h" is 2 hours. "1d" is 1 day.\nAlso supports ISO-8601 format, see {@link Duration}.
org.optaplanner.quarkus.deployment.SolverBuildTimeConfig.moveThreadCount=Enable multithreaded solving for a single problem, which increases CPU consumption.\nDefaults to {@value SolverConfig\#MOVE_THREAD_COUNT_NONE}.\nOther options include {@value SolverConfig\#MOVE_THREAD_COUNT_AUTO}, a number\nor formula based on the available processor count.
org.optaplanner.quarkus.deployment.TerminationBuildTimeConfig.bestScoreLimit=Terminates the solver when a specific or higher score has been reached.\nFor example\: "0hard/-1000soft" terminates when the best score changes from "0hard/-1200soft" to "0hard/-900soft".\nWildcards are supported to replace numbers.\nFor example\: "0hard/*soft" to terminate when any feasible score is reached.
org.optaplanner.quarkus.deployment.SolverManagerBuildTimeConfig.parallelSolverCount=The number of solvers that run in parallel. This directly influences CPU consumption.\nDefaults to {@value SolverManagerConfig\#PARALLEL_SOLVER_COUNT_AUTO}.\nOther options include a number or formula based on the available processor count.
org.optaplanner.quarkus.deployment.SolverBuildTimeConfig.termination=Configuration properties that overwrite OptaPlanner's {@link TerminationConfig}.
org.optaplanner.quarkus.deployment.OptaPlannerBuildTimeConfig.solverManager=Configuration properties that overwrite OptaPlanner's {@link SolverManagerConfig}.
