<p>The dataset component provides a mechanism to easily perform load & soak testing of your system.

 It works by allowing you to create DataSet instances both as a source of messages and as a way to assert that the data set is received.
 Camel will use the throughput logger when sending dataset's.</p>

 <p/>
 This is used for example to assert that <b>exactly</b> a number of messages 
 arrives. For example if {@link #expectedMessageCount(int)} was set to 5, then
 the assertion is satisfied when 5 or more message arrives. To ensure that
 exactly 5 messages arrives, then you would need to wait a little period
 to ensure no further message arrives. This is what you can use this
 {@link #setAssertPeriod(long)} method for.
 <p/>
 By default this period is disabled.

 <b>Beware:</b> If you want to expect that <tt>0</tt> messages, then take extra care,
 as <tt>0</tt> matches when the tests starts, so you need to set a assert period time
 to let the test run for a while to make sure there are still no messages arrived; for
 that use {@link #setAssertPeriod(long)}.
 An alternative is to use <a href="http://camel.apache.org/notifybuilder.html">NotifyBuilder</a>, and use the notifier
 to know when Camel is done routing some messages, before you call the {@link #assertIsSatisfied()} method on the mocks.
 This allows you to not use a fixed assert period, to speedup testing times.
 <p/>
 If you want to assert that <b>exactly</b> n'th message arrives to this mock
 endpoint, then see also the {@link #setAssertPeriod(long)} method for further details.

                expected by this endpoint
