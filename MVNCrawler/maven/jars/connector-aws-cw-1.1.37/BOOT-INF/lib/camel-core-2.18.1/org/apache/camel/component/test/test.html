<b>Scheme:</b> test<br/>
<b>Syntax:</b> test:name<br/>
<b>Description:</b> The test component extends the mock component by on startup to pull messages from another endpoint to set the expected message bodies.<br/>
<b>Deprecated:</b>false<br/>
<b>ProducerOnly:</b>true<br/>
<b>Async:</b>false<br/>
<b>Maven:</b> org.apache.camel/camel-core/2.18.1<br/>
<p>The test component extends the mock component by on startup to pull messages from another endpoint to set the expected message bodies.

 That is, you use the test endpoint in a route and messages arriving on it will be implicitly compared to some
 expected messages extracted from some other location.
 So you can use, for example, an expected set of message bodies as files.
 This will then set up a properly configured Mock endpoint, which is only valid if the received messages
 match the number of expected messages and their message payloads are equal.</p>

 <p/>
 This is used for example to assert that <b>exactly</b> a number of messages 
 arrives. For example if {@link #expectedMessageCount(int)} was set to 5, then
 the assertion is satisfied when 5 or more message arrives. To ensure that
 exactly 5 messages arrives, then you would need to wait a little period
 to ensure no further message arrives. This is what you can use this
 {@link #setAssertPeriod(long)} method for.
 <p/>
 By default this period is disabled.

 <b>Beware:</b> If you want to expect that <tt>0</tt> messages, then take extra care,
 as <tt>0</tt> matches when the tests starts, so you need to set a assert period time
 to let the test run for a while to make sure there are still no messages arrived; for
 that use {@link #setAssertPeriod(long)}.
 An alternative is to use <a href="http://camel.apache.org/notifybuilder.html">NotifyBuilder</a>, and use the notifier
 to know when Camel is done routing some messages, before you call the {@link #assertIsSatisfied()} method on the mocks.
 This allows you to not use a fixed assert period, to speedup testing times.
 <p/>
 If you want to assert that <b>exactly</b> n'th message arrives to this mock
 endpoint, then see also the {@link #setAssertPeriod(long)} method for further details.

 @param expectedCount the number of message exchanges that should be
                expected by this endpoint
