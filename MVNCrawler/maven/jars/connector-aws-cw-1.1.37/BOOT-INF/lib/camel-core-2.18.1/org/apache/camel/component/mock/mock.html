<h1>Mock</h1>
<b>Scheme:</b> mock<br/>
<b>Syntax:</b> mock:name<br/>
<b>Description:</b> The mock component is used for testing routes and mediation rules using mocks.<br/>
<b>Deprecated:</b>false<br/>
<b>ProducerOnly:</b>true<br/>
<b>Async:</b>false<br/>
<b>Maven:</b> org.apache.camel/camel-core/2.18.1<br/>
<p>The mock component is used for testing routes and mediation rules using mocks.
 <p/>
 A Mock endpoint which provides a literate, fluent API for testing routes
 using a <a href="http://jmock.org/">JMock style</a> API.
 <p/>
 The mock endpoint have two set of methods
 <ul>
   <li>expectedXXX or expectsXXX - To set pre conditions, before the test is executed</li>
   <li>assertXXX - To assert assertions, after the test has been executed</li>
 </ul>
 Its <b>important</b> to know the difference between the two set. The former is used to
 set expectations before the test is being started (eg before the mock receives messages).
 The latter is used after the test has been executed, to verify the expectations; or
 other assertions which you can perform after the test has been completed.
 <p/>
 <b>Beware:</b> If you want to expect a mock does not receive any messages, by calling
 {@link #setExpectedMessageCount(int)} with <tt>0</tt>, then take extra care,
 as <tt>0</tt> matches when the tests starts, so you need to set a assert period time
 to let the test run for a while to make sure there are still no messages arrived; for
 that use {@link #setAssertPeriod(long)}.
 An alternative is to use <a href="http://camel.apache.org/notifybuilder.html">NotifyBuilder</a>, and use the notifier
 to know when Camel is done routing some messages, before you call the {@link #assertIsSatisfied()} method on the mocks.
 This allows you to not use a fixed assert period, to speedup testing times.
 <p/>
 <b>Important:</b> If using {@link #expectedMessageCount(int)} and also {@link #expectedBodiesReceived(java.util.List)} or
 {@link #expectedHeaderReceived(String, Object)} then the latter overrides the number of expected message based on the
 number of values provided in the bodies/headers.</p>

 to ensure the preliminary assertion is still valid.
 <p/>
 This is used for example to assert that <b>exactly</b> a number of messages 
 arrives. For example if {@link #expectedMessageCount(int)} was set to 5, then
 the assertion is satisfied when 5 or more message arrives. To ensure that
 exactly 5 messages arrives, then you would need to wait a little period
 to ensure no further message arrives. This is what you can use this
 {@link #setAssertPeriod(long)} method for.
 <p/>
 By default this period is disabled.

 <b>Important:</b> When using this limitation, then the {@link #getReceivedCounter()}

 if we have received 5000 {@link Exchange}s, and have configured to only retain the first
 10 {@link Exchange}s, then the {@link #getReceivedCounter()} will still return <tt>5000</tt>

 {@link #getReceivedExchanges()} methods.
 <p/>
 When using this method, then some of the other expectation methods is not supported,
 for example the {@link #expectedBodiesReceived(Object...)} sets a expectation on the first
 number of bodies received.
 <p/>
 You can configure both {@link #setRetainFirst(int)} and {@link #setRetainLast(int)} methods,
 to limit both the first and last received.
