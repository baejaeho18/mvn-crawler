 For consumers, it's used as a filename filter.
 For producers, it's used to evaluate the filename to write.
 If an expression is set, it take precedence over the CamelFileName header. (Note: The header itself can also be an Expression).
 The expression options support both String and Expression types.
 If the expression is a String type, it is always evaluated using the File Language.
 If the expression is an Expression type, the specified Expression type is used - this allows you,
 for instance, to use OGNL expressions. For the consumer, you can use it to filter filenames,
 so you can for instance consume today's file using the File Language syntax: mydata-${date:now:yyyyMMdd}.txt.
 The producers support the CamelOverruleFileName header which takes precedence over any existing CamelFileName header;
 the CamelOverruleFileName is a header that is used only once, and makes it easier as this avoids to temporary
 store CamelFileName and have to restore it afterwards.</td>

 renamed to the target filename. This option is also used to control whether to delete any existing files when

    <td>Used by consumer, to only poll the files if it has exclusive read-lock on the file (i.e. the file is not in-progress or being written).
 Camel will wait until the file lock is granted.
 <p/>
 This option provides the build in strategies:
 <ul>
     <li>none - No read lock is in use
     <li>markerFile - Camel creates a marker file (fileName.camelLock) and then holds a lock on it. This option is not available for the FTP component
     <li>changed - Changed is using file length/modification timestamp to detect whether the file is currently being copied or not. Will at least use 1 sec
     to determine this, so this option cannot consume files as fast as the others, but can be more reliable as the JDK IO API cannot
     always determine whether a file is currently being used by another process. The option readLockCheckInterval can be used to set the check frequency.</li>
     <li>fileLock - is for using java.nio.channels.FileLock. This option is not avail for the FTP component. This approach should be avoided when accessing
     a remote file system via a mount/share unless that file system supports distributed file locks.</li>
     <li>rename - rename is for using a try to rename the file as a test if we can get exclusive read-lock.</li>
     <li>idempotent - (only for file component) idempotent is for using a idempotentRepository as the read-lock.
     This allows to use read locks that supports clustering if the idempotent repository implementation supports that.</li>
 </ul>
 Notice: The various read locks is not all suited to work in clustered mode, where concurrent consumers on different nodes is competing
 for the same files on a shared file system. The markerFile using a close to atomic operation to create the empty marker file,
 but its not guaranteed to work in a cluster. The fileLock may work better but then the file system need to support distributed file locks, and so on.
 Using the idempotent read lock can support clustering if the idempotent repository supports clustering, such as Hazelcast Component or Infinispan.</td>
